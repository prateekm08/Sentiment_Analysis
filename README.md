# Sentiment Analysis on airline twitter data

This is a PyTorch implementation of sentiment analysis on customer tweets to airlines. I have implemented this as part of 'Mumbai Hackathon' and the dataset can be obtained <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment">here</a>. I will improve this when I get the time but a simple LSTM performs well so far. Tell me your thoughts :)
